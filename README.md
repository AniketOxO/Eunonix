**"Upgrade Yourself, One Thought at a Time."**

A calm digital sanctuary for personal growth. Technology that feels like therapy, not pressure.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Visual Language**: The Calm Future — soft minimalism inspired by Apple, Calm, and Muji
- **Core Metaphor**: The mind as a flowing interface — like water adapting to its container
- **Motion**: Everything breathes quietly, creating a living atmosphere without overwhelm

## 🌊 Core Principles

1. **Understand** — Mood & thought insights visualized like pulse lines
2. **Sync** — Connect tasks, notes, health data, and schedule
3. **Evolve** — Guidance + reflections suggested by AI

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

## 🎨 Design System

- **Colors**: Soft neutrals (sand, lilac, ink blue, golden)
- **Typography**: Inter (humanistic, rounded)
- **Motion**: Breathing animations that match user rhythm
- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves you
