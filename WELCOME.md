## 🌊 The Emotion System

Your interface adapts to 4 emotional states:

| Emotion | Color | When To Use |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 😌 **Calm** | Blue tones | Reflection, deep thinking, peace |
| 🚀 **Motivated** | Golden tones | Creativity, energy, action |
| 💗 **Empathetic** | Pink tones | Connection, openness, care |
| 🌙 **Rest** | Gray tones | Recovery, pause, sleep prep |

The background color and UI elements shift based on the dominant emotion!

---

## 💡 Philosophy in Action

Every pixel follows these principles:

> **"Technology should feel like therapy, not pressure."**

- Animations breathe at a calm 4-6 second rhythm
- No flashing or jarring transitions
- Colors are soft and easy on the eyes
- Text is light and encouraging, never demanding

> **"Your mind deserves peace, not performance."**

- No productivity metrics or guilt-inducing charts
- Visual flow instead of numerical pressure
- Reflection over optimization
- Growth over grind

### Glass Cards
Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur, giving depth while maintaining lightness.

SVG-based emotional rhythm visualization — your mood as a living waveform.
